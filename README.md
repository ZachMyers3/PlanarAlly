**Offline support**: This tool can be used in a completely offline set-up for when you play D&D in a dark dungeon.

**Simple layers**: Organize your scenes in layers for easier management.\
**Infinite canvas**: When a limited workspace is still nog enough!\
**Dynamic lighting**: Increase your immersion by working with light and shadows.\
